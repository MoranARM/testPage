            Welcome to Dog Page, a wonderful place to find the best dogs around!

            <em>Dogs can bark</em>
            There are many variations of dogs, which comes with the high variance of their barks too.

        <h3>Sizes of Dogs</h3>
        <p>
            Dogs come in many sizes. The small ones could fit inside a little bag and be brought <strong>everywhere</strong>. Other dogs are so large that small children could ride them like a pony.

        <h3>Breeds of Dogs</h3>
        <p>
            There are far too many different breeds for me to ever know them all, but that doesn't mean it is not important to learn at least a few.
